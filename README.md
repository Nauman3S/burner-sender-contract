# Token Supply Burner and NFT Sender Solana Contract

This is a Solana Contract in Rust with two functions: 
one to burn token supply and another to send NFT to a user's wallet.

## Installation

* Install the Solana SDK, CLI, and Rust tools by following the instructions at [solana-cli-tools](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools)

## Details

This code provides a minimal example of how to implement the two requested functions. The burn token supply function takes the token mint and the amount to burn, while the send function transfers an NFT to the user's wallet.

To run and deploy the program, you will need to set up a local Solana testnet and fund your wallet with test tokens. Follow the instructions provided in the Solana documentation at https://docs.solana.com/developing/on-solana/cli/deploy-a-testnet

Please note that this example is not production-ready and lacks proper error handling and input validation. Use it as a starting point to build more robust programs.
